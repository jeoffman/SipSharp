            // 3xx class response as detailed in Sections 16.5 and 16.6.  A client
            // starts with an initial target set containing exactly one URI, the
            // Request-URI of the original request.  If a client wishes to formulate
            // new requests based on a 3xx class response to that request, it places
            // the URIs to try into the target set.  Subject to the restrictions in
            // this specification, a client can choose which Contact URIs it places
            // into the target set.  As with proxy recursion, a client processing
            // 3xx class responses MUST NOT add any given URI to the target set more
            // than once.  If the original request had a SIPS URI in the Request-
            // URI, the client MAY choose to recurse to a non-SIPS URI, but SHOULD
            // inform the user of the redirection to an insecure URI.


            //    Any new request may receive 3xx responses themselves containing
            //    the original URI as a contact.  Two locations can be configured to
            //    redirect to each other.  Placing any given URI in the target set
            //    only once prevents infinite redirection loops.

            // As the target set grows, the client MAY generate new requests to the
            // URIs in any order.  A common mechanism is to order the set by the "q"
            // parameter value from the Contact header field value.  Requests to the
            // URIs MAY be generated serially or in parallel.  One approach is to
            // process groups of decreasing q-values serially and process the URIs
            // in each q-value group in parallel.  Another is to perform only serial
            // processing in decreasing q-value order, arbitrarily choosing between
            // contacts of equal q-value.

            // If contacting an address in the list results in a failure, as defined
            // in the next paragraph, the element moves to the next address in the
            // list, until the list is exhausted.  If the list is exhausted, then
            // the request has failed.

            // Failures SHOULD be detected through failure response codes (codes
            // greater than 399); for network errors the client transaction will
            // report any transport layer failures to the transaction user.  Note
            // that some response codes (detailed in 8.1.3.5) indicate that the
            // request can be retried; requests that are reattempted should not be
            // considered failures.

            // When a failure for a particular contact address is received, the
            // client SHOULD try the next contact address.  This will involve
            // creating a new client transaction to deliver a new request.

            // In order to create a request based on a contact address in a 3xx
            // response, a UAC MUST copy the entire URI from the target set into the
            // Request-URI, except for the "method-param" and "header" URI
            // parameters (see Section 19.1.1 for a definition of these parameters).
            // It uses the "header" parameters to create header field values for the
            // new request, overwriting header field values associated with the
            // redirected request in accordance with the guidelines in Section
            // 19.1.5.

            // Note that in some instances, header fields that have been
            // communicated in the contact address may instead append to existing
            // request header fields in the original redirected request.  As a
            // general rule, if the header field can accept a comma-separated list
            // of values, then the new header field value MAY be appended to any
            // existing values in the original redirected request.  If the header
            // field does not accept multiple values, the value in the original
            // redirected request MAY be overwritten by the header field value
            // communicated in the contact address.  For example, if a contact
            // address is returned with the following value:

            //    sip:user@host?Subject=foo&Call-Info=<http://www.foo.com>

            // Then any Subject header field in the original redirected request is
            // overwritten, but the HTTP URL is merely appended to any existing
            // Call-Info header field values.

            // It is RECOMMENDED that the UAC reuse the same To, From, and Call-ID
            // used in the original redirected request, but the UAC MAY also choose
            // to update the Call-ID header field value for new requests, for
            // example.

            // Finally, once the new request has been constructed, it is sent using
            // a new client transaction, and therefore MUST have a new branch ID in
            // the top Via field as discussed in Section 8.1.1.7.
