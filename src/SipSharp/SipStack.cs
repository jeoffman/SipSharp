            //    Once a request is authenticated (or authentication is skipped), the
            //    UAS MUST inspect the method of the request.  If the UAS recognizes
            //    but does not support the method of a request, it MUST generate a 405
            //    (Method Not Allowed) response.  Procedures for generating responses
            //    are described in Section 8.2.6.  The UAS MUST also add an Allow
            //    header field to the 405 (Method Not Allowed) response.  The Allow
            //    header field MUST list the set of methods supported by the UAS
            //    generating the message.  The Allow header field is presented in
            //    Section 20.5.
            // 
            //    If the method is one supported by the server, processing continues.

            // 
            // 8.2.2 Header Inspection
            // 
            //    If a UAS does not understand a header field in a request (that is,
            //    the header field is not defined in this specification or in any
            //    supported extension), the server MUST ignore that header field and
            //    continue processing the message.  A UAS SHOULD ignore any malformed
            //    header fields that are not necessary for processing requests.
            // 
            // 8.2.2.1 To and Request-URI
            // 
            //    The To header field identifies the original recipient of the request
            //    designated by the user identified in the From field.  The original
            //    recipient may or may not be the UAS processing the request, due to
            //    call forwarding or other proxy operations.  A UAS MAY apply any
            //    policy it wishes to determine whether to accept requests when the To
            //    header field is not the identity of the UAS.  However, it is
            //    RECOMMENDED that a UAS accept requests even if they do not recognize
            //    the URI scheme (for example, a tel: URI) in the To header field, or
            //    if the To header field does not address a known or current user of
            //    this UAS.  If, on the other hand, the UAS decides to reject the
            //    request, it SHOULD generate a response with a 403 (Forbidden) status
            //    code and pass it to the server transaction for transmission.
            // 
            //    However, the Request-URI identifies the UAS that is to process the
            //    request.  If the Request-URI uses a scheme not supported by the UAS,
            //    it SHOULD reject the request with a 416 (Unsupported URI Scheme)
            //    response.  If the Request-URI does not identify an address that the
            //    UAS is willing to accept requests for, it SHOULD reject the request
            //    with a 404 (Not Found) response.  Typically, a UA that uses the
            //    REGISTER method to bind its address-of-record to a specific contact
            //    address will see requests whose Request-URI equals that contact
            //    address.  Other potential sources of received Request-URIs include
            //    the Contact header fields of requests and responses sent by the UA
            //    that establish or refresh dialogs.
            // 
            // 8.2.2.2 Merged Requests
            // 
            //    If the request has no tag in the To header field, the UAS core MUST
            //    check the request against ongoing transactions.  If the From tag,
            //    Call-ID, and CSeq exactly match those associated with an ongoing
            //    transaction, but the request does not match that transaction (based
            //    on the matching rules in Section 17.2.3), the UAS core SHOULD
            //    generate a 482 (Loop Detected) response and pass it to the server
            //    transaction.
            // 
            //       The same request has arrived at the UAS more than once, following
            //       different paths, most likely due to forking.  The UAS processes
            //       the first such request received and responds with a 482 (Loop
            //       Detected) to the rest of them.
            // 
            // 8.2.2.3 Require
            // 
            //    Assuming the UAS decides that it is the proper element to process the
            //    request, it examines the Require header field, if present.
            // 
            //    The Require header field is used by a UAC to tell a UAS about SIP
            //    extensions that the UAC expects the UAS to support in order to
            //    process the request properly.  Its format is described in Section
            //    20.32.  If a UAS does not understand an option-tag listed in a
            //    Require header field, it MUST respond by generating a response with
            //    status code 420 (Bad Extension).  The UAS MUST add an Unsupported
            //    header field, and list in it those options it does not understand
            //    amongst those in the Require header field of the request.
            // 
            //    Require and Proxy-Require MUST NOT be used in a SIP CANCEL
            //    request, or in an ACK request sent for a non-2xx response.  These
            //    header fields MUST be ignored if they are present in these requests.
            // 
            //    An ACK request for a 2xx response MUST contain only those Require and
            //    Proxy-Require values that were present in the initial request.
            // 
            //    Example:
            // 
            //       UAC->UAS:   INVITE sip:watson@bell-telephone.com SIP/2.0
            //                   Require: 100rel
            // 
            //       UAS->UAC:   SIP/2.0 420 Bad Extension
            //                   Unsupported: 100rel
            // 
            //       This behavior ensures that the client-server interaction will
            //       proceed without delay when all options are understood by both
            //       sides, and only slow down if options are not understood (as in the
            //       example above).  For a well-matched client-server pair, the
            //       interaction proceeds quickly, saving a round-trip often required
            //       by negotiation mechanisms.  In addition, it also removes ambiguity
            //       when the client requires features that the server does not
            //       understand.  Some features, such as call handling fields, are only
            //       of interest to end systems.
            // 
            // 8.2.3 Content Processing
            // 
            //    Assuming the UAS understands any extensions required by the client,
            //    the UAS examines the body of the message, and the header fields that
            //    describe it.  If there are any bodies whose type (indicated by the
            //    Content-Type), language (indicated by the Content-Language) or
            //    encoding (indicated by the Content-Encoding) are not understood, and
            //    that body part is not optional (as indicated by the Content-
            //    Disposition header field), the UAS MUST reject the request with a 415
            //    (Unsupported Media Type) response.  The response MUST contain an
            //    Accept header field listing the types of all bodies it understands,
            //    in the event the request contained bodies of types not supported by
            //    the UAS.  If the request contained content encodings not understood
            //    by the UAS, the response MUST contain an Accept-Encoding header field
            //    listing the encodings understood by the UAS.  If the request
            //    contained content with languages not understood by the UAS, the
            //    response MUST contain an Accept-Language header field indicating the
            //    languages understood by the UAS.  Beyond these checks, body handling
            //    depends on the method and type.  For further information on the
            //    processing of content-specific header fields, see Section 7.4 as well
            //    as Section 20.11 through 20.15.
            // 
            // 8.2.4 Applying Extensions
            // 
            //    A UAS that wishes to apply some extension when generating the
            //    response MUST NOT do so unless support for that extension is
            //    indicated in the Supported header field in the request.  If the
            //    desired extension is not supported, the server SHOULD rely only on
            //    baseline SIP and any other extensions supported by the client.  In
            //    rare circumstances, where the server cannot process the request
            //    without the extension, the server MAY send a 421 (Extension Required)
            //    response.  This response indicates that the proper response cannot be
            //    generated without support of a specific extension.  The needed
            //    extension(s) MUST be included in a Require header field in the
            //    response.  This behavior is NOT RECOMMENDED, as it will generally
            //    break interoperability.
            // 
            //    Any extensions applied to a non-421 response MUST be listed in a
            //    Require header field included in the response.  Of course, the server
            //    MUST NOT apply extensions not listed in the Supported header field in
            //    the request.  As a result of this, the Require header field in a
            //    response will only ever contain option tags defined in standards-
            //    track RFCs.
            // 
            // 8.2.5 Processing the Request
            // 
            //    Assuming all of the checks in the previous subsections are passed,
            //    the UAS processing becomes method-specific.  Section 10 covers the
            //    REGISTER request, Section 11 covers the OPTIONS request, Section 13
            //    covers the INVITE request, and Section 15 covers the BYE request.
            // 

            #region 8.2.6 Generating the Response

            // 
            //    When a UAS wishes to construct a response to a request, it follows
            //    the general procedures detailed in the following subsections.
            //    Additional behaviors specific to the response code in question, which
            //    are not detailed in this section, may also be required.
            // 
            //    Once all procedures associated with the creation of a response have
            //    been completed, the UAS hands the response back to the server
            //    transaction from which it received the request.
            // 
            // 8.2.6.1 Sending a Provisional Response
            // 
            //    One largely non-method-specific guideline for the generation of
            //    responses is that UASs SHOULD NOT issue a provisional response for a
            //    non-INVITE request.  Rather, UASs SHOULD generate a final response to
            //    a non-INVITE request as soon as possible.
            // 
            // 
            //    When a 100 (Trying) response is generated, any Timestamp header field
            //    present in the request MUST be copied into this 100 (Trying)
            //    response.  If there is a delay in generating the response, the UAS
            //    SHOULD add a delay value into the Timestamp value in the response.
            //    This value MUST contain the difference between the time of sending of
            //    the response and receipt of the request, measured in seconds.
            // 
            // 8.2.6.2 Headers and Tags
            // 
            //    The From field of the response MUST equal the From header field of
            //    the request.  The Call-ID header field of the response MUST equal the
            //    Call-ID header field of the request.  The CSeq header field of the
            //    response MUST equal the CSeq field of the request.  The Via header
            //    field values in the response MUST equal the Via header field values
            //    in the request and MUST maintain the same ordering.
            // 
            //    If a request contained a To tag in the request, the To header field
            //    in the response MUST equal that of the request.  However, if the To
            //    header field in the request did not contain a tag, the URI in the To
            //    header field in the response MUST equal the URI in the To header
            //    field; additionally, the UAS MUST add a tag to the To header field in
            //    the response (with the exception of the 100 (Trying) response, in
            //    which a tag MAY be present).  This serves to identify the UAS that is
            //    responding, possibly resulting in a component of a dialog ID.  The
            //    same tag MUST be used for all responses to that request, both final
            //    and provisional (again excepting the 100 (Trying)).  Procedures for
            //    the generation of tags are defined in Section 19.3.
            // 
            // 8.2.7 Stateless UAS Behavior
            // 
            //    A stateless UAS is a UAS that does not maintain transaction state.
            //    It replies to requests normally, but discards any state that would
            //    ordinarily be retained by a UAS after a response has been sent.  If a
            //    stateless UAS receives a retransmission of a request, it regenerates
            //    the response and resends it, just as if it were replying to the first
            //    instance of the request. A UAS cannot be stateless unless the request
            //    processing for that method would always result in the same response
            //    if the requests are identical. This rules out stateless registrars,
            //    for example.  Stateless UASs do not use a transaction layer; they
            //    receive requests directly from the transport layer and send responses
            //    directly to the transport layer.
            // 
            //    The stateless UAS role is needed primarily to handle unauthenticated
            //    requests for which a challenge response is issued.  If
            //    unauthenticated requests were handled statefully, then malicious

            //

            // 
            //       o  To header tags MUST be generated for responses in a stateless
            //          manner - in a manner that will generate the same tag for the
            //          same request consistently.  For information on tag construction
            //          see Section 19.3.
